                <h2>This is my code of honor:</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>you're not a clown. if you're a ghoul, spamming zxczxcxczxcxzxc, pausing after every kill for no reason, and just a poser, that doesn't mean you're a ghoul, and you have no right to call yourself a ghoul.
                        <li>you should give a fuck. you're an amoral, you have no morals. you were told to fuck off, you're a loser? don't embarrass yourself, don't make excuses, don't answer back, you want to prove it - prove it, destroy it in zxc, you're not a tolerate, you're not wasting your time. you promised to break things? beat them, stand in amulet, answer for your words</li>
                        <li>don't give a fuck. you got 3k pts and you're smurfing? shut up, it's your mp, you're playing to win and don't take credit for what you didn't get. no one owes you anything and neither do you. if you're breaking stuff because your not getting pipped by a keeper then you're a whiner, you're not a ghoul</li>
                        <li>each ghoul should at least know what a zxc is, and even more so, be able to stand up for yourself there. if it's ok for a man to accidentally fist-bump another man, it's also ok for a ghoul to respond or make him answer for his zxc words. don't be a wimp, you're stronger.</li>
                        <li>focus on the game, zitraks mod. your main goal is to win, you should be able to give all mute, deal with tilts and win unbeaten. enemies should be afraid of googles and not laugh with a rage bb whiner</li>
                        <li>if you're worthy to be called a ghoul, you're a priori putting yourself above the rest. if you're confident, take the role, fpsh the hero, your game - your rules, but don't ruin it before you get ruined. piked double mid? go to the cafe in the woods and drag solo, don't forget to pause at the death of the fucker and stomp on it, mock them, but do not become a laughing stock, win every game unless the team wanted or deserved to lose, your choice</li>
                        <li>all chat doesn't exist for you, why do you have to write your enemies something other than "?" after the kills and ")" after the fall of the throne?</li>
                        <li>killed a mider on fb? f9 + ?. the enemy's throne falls? ")" in all chat, but no more, you are not a clown.</li>
                        <li>ghouls are normal, you are not a toxic pig and a poser, you are normal, porofle with your team if you want, communicate well with your guys if you need to, respect those who really deserve it.</li>
                        <li>Ego is a positive quality, you are stronger and better than everyone else, but you have to justify it</li>
                        <li>be true to their ideals. you do not need to have a googly in the veil, why this, put a Lil Peep or Gosling if you want, keep your ideals, but your nickname should not be disgusting</li>
                        <li>never use capital letters. write in code, don't be a boor, this is beneath you.</li>
                        <li>remember for the last time, you're not a clown, or a poser, or a whiner.</li>
                        <li>follow all the rules, or you're not a ghoul.</li>
